# Hierarchical Module Using Verilog
Inside this Module there are 32 bit carry save adder with 8 stage of pipelines where each stage using 4 bit carry look-ahead adder, 16 bit random number generator, 16 bit prime number generator within range given (m,n)  and 32 bit binary counter.
Two years ago I made this project and lost the .v file because I had to reinstall the windows for a reason.

This code will work and I also have code for test bench.
Feel free to ask me if anyone can help me to improve this project or if anyone need any help about the project.
